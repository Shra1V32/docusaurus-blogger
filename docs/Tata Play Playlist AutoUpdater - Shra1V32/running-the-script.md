# Running the script
* Copy the below script and paste it in the Cloud Shell/Terminal:
```bash
bash <(curl -s 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shra1V32/TataSky-Playlist-AutoUpdater/main/curl.sh')
```
* Please wait until the setup is complete. ⏳
* Now, Under Main Menu, Select option 1, **Login using RMN & OTP** 📲
* Enter the required details, After entering valid information, You'll be logged in successfully.
  * If you ran into an error saying login failed, Then you probably must use alternate ways of using script ❌
  * After you successfully log in, You'll see the Login Status as True. ✅
* Now, To generate your permanent playlist URL, You need to select option 5, i.e, **Build My AutoUpdater** 🔄
* And That's it there you go, After a few seconds, you'll be greeted with a new repo and your playlist URL created in your account that makes the job of updating the playlist every day. 🎉
* Now if you want to reuse the script again, Just simply do the following: 
```bash
cd && cd TataSky-Playlist-AutoUpdater;
./main.sh
```
All the steps above are to be done only once.
