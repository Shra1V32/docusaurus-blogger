# How to use
I know you would love to get your hands on how this works, but hold on and read before you proceed further
 > The methods are divided into `Easy` and `Difficult` based on how comfortable you are with the commandline. The `Easy` guide is recommended if you have no working knowledge of Python or scripting in general
## The Easy Way (Using an App)

- Login with your SID, RMN and OTP/ Password(deprecated) first
- Once you login, your details are saved to your local storage so that you don't have to enter the details again and again
- Every 24 hours, the playlist expires, so the app gives you the next expiry time and you will have to generate your playlist again before that time
- The app can be found in the [releases page](https://github.com/ForceGT/Tata-Sky-IPTV/releases)
```
Minimum Supported  Android Version : Android 5.0
```

## The Difficult Way (Using a Script)
### Setting up your environment

+ Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) up and running on your system. **If you don't know how to do this then well, don't think of proceeding further**
+ You need `requests` to be installed. Do that by using ``pip install requests``
